  <p>The most exclusive & romantic of all Florida Keys resorts - experience a piece of paradise.

  <p>The sea sparkles at the most exclusive of Florida Keys Resorts in the late-afternoon sun and the only decision of the day is whether to wake up for an early morning snorkel or lounge lazily enjoying a leisurely frolic. The best part? This is your romantic retreat and you never have to admit to anything.

  <p>Our Florida Keys resort & spa is a piece of paradise discreetly located off the fabled Florida Keys coastline so remote it's only accessible by seaplane or boat. A best-kept secret for US presidents and celebrities, your escape is simply waiting to drink you in. No phones, no TVs and no shortage of fun and romance. Can you live without your iPhone? Come visit and find out! Romance abounds in air-conditioned thatched roof bungalow suites, with custom-made beds draped under plush mosquito netting. White paths of crushed seashells meander through nearly six acres of tropical flowers, palm trees and sandy beaches. Enjoy the isolation of an outdoor shower, a dip in your private hot tub and every one of the requisite luxuries.
